It was difficult to think about a system that elliminates jooints and at the same time reduces compplexity of the solution. I made loked for cardboard tubes and ordered 20 layers of 1x1 m regular cardboard to be cut with the desgin.
The result is 3 pieces system that can be used anywhere and it's specially fun for kids and teenagers. Yoou can even stand on it and it can be used for making stairs 3 m tall.
