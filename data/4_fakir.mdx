<h3>Fakir is a new furniture system specially designs for children and teenargers. It's made with 100%% recyclable and reusable elements and is able to reproduce nearly every piece for furniture that you can have at home.</h3>

It was difficult to think about a system that elliminates joints and at the same time reduces complexity of the solution. I looked for cardboard tubes and used 20 layers of 1x1 m regular cardboard for the models.
The result is a 3-pieces-system that can be used anywhere and it's specially fun for kids and teenagers. You can even stand on it and it can be used for making stairs 3 m tall.
