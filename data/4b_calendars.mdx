What's time? What's a year? and a day? Since XVc, when Salamanca's scientists defined the most exact meassure of the year -that we keep using today- the occidental world, and the political world in general has been influenced by this conception of time. We've been so defined by this modular divission of time that we cant'see the consecuences in our brain, body and soul of this political meassures.

I've been strugglling with the perception of time since chilhood, when I used to consider a year a square, where the corners were occupied by my main events in my year, and the rest was divided by months proportionally to fit those corners:

The geometric divission of the year was helpful to feel the year in a different way. You can see it doesn't match exacly the seasons, it redefines the 4 periods of the year by emotional seasons. Four corners are : Chrismas, Summer Holydays starting month, summer Holydays ending month andd all Saints Day (November 1st). </p>

Así como las estaciones afectan al medio, así me afectaba a mí esta imagen cuadrada del año, cada esquina es un punto de impulso hacia la siguiente estación de reposo.

Otro ejemplo de distribución temporal que usé con los años es la asignación de formas a los días de la semana. I used this as a diary, making a little drawing inside each shape.
Erasing the numbers from my calendaar allowed me to dismantle the weekdays columns and start looking for different realtions between months and take more advantage of the space it's represented.
