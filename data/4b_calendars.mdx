What's time? What's a year? and a day? Since XVc, when Salamanca's scientists defined the most exact meassure of the year -that we keep using today- the occidental world, and the political world in general has been influenced by this conception of time. We've been so defined by this modular divission of time that we cant'see the consecuences in our brain, body and soul of this political meassures.

I've been strugglling with the perception of time since chilhood, when I used to consider a year a square, where the corners were occupied by my main events in my year, and the rest was divided by months proportionally to fit those corners:

The geometric divission of the year was incredible help. Not just for making the periods in between seasons shorter but also to feel the year in a different way.

It was difficult to think about a system that elliminates jooints and at the same time reduces compplexity of the solution. I made loked for cardboard tubes and ordered 20 layers of 1x1 m regular cardboard to be cut with the desgin.
The result is 3 pieces system that can be used anywhere and it's specially fun for kids and teenagers. Yoou can even stand on it and it can be used for making stairs 3 m tall.
