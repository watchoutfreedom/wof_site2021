<h2>What's time? What's a year? And a day?</h2>

<p>Since XVc, when Salamanca's scientists defined the most exact algorithm to calculate what's a year <a href="https://www.academia.edu/3801681/Reforming_the_Calendar_at_the_University_of_Salamanca_ca_1468_Pedro_Mart%C3%ADnez_de_Osma_and_his_Disputatio_de_anno_">-that we keep using today-</a>, the occidental world, and the political world in general has been influenced by this conception of time. We've been so defined by this modular divission of time that we can't see the consecuences in our brain, body and soul of this political meassures.</p>

I've been strugglling with the perception of time since the chilhood, when I used to consider a year a square: Main events in my year were in the corners, and the rest was divided by months proportionally to fit those corners:

The geometric divission of the year was helpful to feel it in a different way. You can see it doesn't match exacly the seasons, it redefines the 4 periods of the year by emotional seasons. Four corners are : Chrismas, summer holidays starting month, summer holidays ending month and all Saints Day (November 1st).

<h3>I continue to see the year like this in my mind when I think about dates, it's like playing Monopoly, being Xmas the starting point.</h3>

Así como las estaciones afectan al medio, así me afectaba a mí esta imagen cuadrada del año, cada esquina es un punto de impulso hacia la siguiente estación de reposo.

Otro ejemplo de distribución temporal que usé con los años es la asignación de formas a los días de la semana. I used this as a diary, making a little drawing inside each shape.

<h2>Representing time is a game that can help you to understand your life in a differente way, and also live differently.</h2>

Erasing the numbers from my calendaar allowed me to dismantle the weekdays columns and start looking for different realtions between months, weeks and days and represent it in smaller space.

<h3>And you? How would you represent time?</h3>
