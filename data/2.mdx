<p><a href="http://www.helpbuttons.org">Helbuttons.org</a> is an useful new collaborative tool, 100% customizable and open to be adapted to user needs. Each offer or request for help becomes a button that can be shared online and pushed by any other person.  The app does not seek to set limits or benefit from user exchanges: its purpose is to make collaboration easier in any field, not just from an economic point of view.</p>

<p>It shows not only the trending topics but also those which are best rated by users and aims to help in those fields. You can also use it to create your own collaborative tool for you own purposes and make a collaborative community in your neighborhood, town, organization or institution.</p>

<p>The tool was designed through the cooperation of physicists, sociologists, economists, engineers and programmers. The final version was developed in collaboration with <a href="http://codecantor.com">Codecantor</a>.</p>
