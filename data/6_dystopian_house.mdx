<h3>Building design based on human anatomy?</h3>

This is a first series of drawings and thoughts that could lead to new architectural typologies.
They're not ideal buildings, I'm just combining how social habits and needs are being attended today with a futuristic interpretation of where it could lead to:
<h3>The dystopian architecture, due to the development of tech (robotics, artificial intelligence, new materials, processors, etc), will never need to follow the principles of the past architecture. Even if we don't like that idea, the same building could become a home but also a prision, just because the political and economical power could interact with every aspect of our daily life from a computer. We won't need to go out from our buildings for any reason, unless we have a pet :).

<h3>
This conception makes the potential building of the future an independent being, more autonomous not only in a techonolgical way but also in social and enviromental interactions. Buildings will be closer to beings cause they are the ones that consume, communicate and even move in the new era. They are farer to machines (XXc Le Corbusier living machine), cause they are not tools any more, they use humans as tools to survive, in the same way that states and big companies do (buildings would be extensions of them).

Our dystopian future buildings will have the habilities of the living beings: feed, reproduce, communicate, move. And maybe will loook like this :

The XX century futuristic and utopian architecture designs (based on techonological improvements) won't be utopian any more, they will just be a nightmare. Why? Because technological changes are a tool, not a must. Architecture, and specially home architecture, doesn't need to incorporate every so called techonological improvement for the sake of it. At least in design, first comes the need, then the tool. By letting in every new idea that the power funds, we're less in our home and more in the home of others.

The influence of the outer world into the inner world of our homes has become so strong that we don't even notice. It's the outer world, both real and virtual, the one that determines the limits of our homes. In the dystopian homes those limits come together, so the control of Augmented Reality in any sense would be ensential to develop our lifes, and also to be succesful both at work and in personal relations.
