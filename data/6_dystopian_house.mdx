(English/Espa√±ol) <h3>Building design based on human anatomy?</h3>
As a result of this research I present these drawings and thoughts than can maybe lead to new typologies.
It's not an ideal building, I'm just combining how I think the social habits and needs are being attended today. A future interpretation of where it could lead to:
<h4>Being that said, the dystopian architecture, due to the development of tech (robotics, artificiall intelligence, new materials, prcessors, etc), will never need to follow the same principles of the past architecture. Even if we don't like that idea, building could become a home but also a prision, just because the political and economical power could interacts with every aspect of our daily life (from a computer). We won't need to go out from our buildings for any reason, unless we have a pet :).</h4>

This conception makes the potential buildings of the future an independent being, more autonomous not only in techonolgical way but also in social and enviromental interactions. Buildings will be closer to beings cause they are the ones that consume, communicate and even move in the new era. They are farer to machines (XXc Le Corbusier living machine), cause they are not tools any more, they use humans as tools to survive.

Our dysttopian future buildings will have the habbilities of the living beings: feed, reproduce, communicate, move. And maybe will loook like this :

The influence of the outer world into the inner world of our homes has become so strong that we don't even notice. Is the outer world, both real and virtual the one that determines the limits of our homes. In the dystopian homes these limits come together, so the control of Augmented Reality in any sense would be ensential to develop our lifes, to be succesful both at work and in personal relations.
